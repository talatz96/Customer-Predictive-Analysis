# Customer-Predictive-Analysis
I performed predictive analysis on Customers on the basis of their past purchases. The predicted values included: Customer Lifetime Value, Number of Purchases over one year, Average Profit over one year and the Probability of a customer staying active over the next year. After predicting these values, I segmented the audiences into three segments based on their predicted lifetime value (Medium CLV, Low CLV, and High CLV) as well as into four segments on the basis of all four predicted measures. 
This could help marketers determine which customers are worth investing in and how much should be invested on them, along with getting to know which customers have the potential to bring good profits.

Attributes required:

- Customer ID
- Order Date
- Cost of Items Purchased
- Quantity of Items Purchased
